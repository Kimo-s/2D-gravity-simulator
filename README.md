To create an object click your mouse once and a line will show; click again to make an object at the position of the mouse. This object will have initial force magnitude proportional to how long the line is and in the diraction of the line. 

The program starts with a big ball in the middle which has a lot more mass than the objects created by the user. This should be used as the planet to make the objects orbit around it.

Issue: the program does not have any kind of collision detection yet so objects in the game may just fly away very fast when they approach each other to the center or very close to it.
